    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <tree>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    criterion : string, optional (default="gini")
        The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria are
        "gini" for the Gini impurity and "entropy" for the information gain.

    splitter : string, optional (default="best")
        The strategy used to choose the split at each node. Supported
        strategies are "best" to choose the best split and "random" to choose
        the best random split.

    max_features : int, float, string or None, optional (default=None)
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:

            - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
            - If float, then `max_features` is a percentage and
              `int(max_features * n_features)` features are considered at each
              split.
            - If "auto", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
            - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
            - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
            - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.

        Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
        valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
        effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.

    max_depth : int or None, optional (default=None)
        The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until
        all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
        min_samples_split samples.

    min_samples_split : int, float, optional (default=2)
        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a percentage and
          `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each split.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.18
           Added float values for percentages.

    min_samples_leaf : int, float, optional (default=1)
        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node:

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a percentage and
          `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each node.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.18
           Added float values for percentages.

    min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, optional (default=0.)
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
        the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

    max_leaf_nodes : int or None, optional (default=None)
        Grow a tree with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
        Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
        If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.

    class_weight : dict, list of dicts, "balanced" or None, optional (default=None)
        Weights associated with classes in the form ``{class_label: weight}``.
        If not given, all classes are supposed to have weight one. For
        multi-output problems, a list of dicts can be provided in the same
        order as the columns of y.

        The "balanced" mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust
        weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data
        as ``n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))``

        For multi-output, the weights of each column of y will be multiplied.

        Note that these weights will be multiplied with sample_weight (passed
        through the fit method) if sample_weight is specified.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default=None)
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by `np.random`.

    min_impurity_split : float, optional (default=1e-7)
        Threshold for early stopping in tree growth. A node will split
        if its impurity is above the threshold, otherwise it is a leaf.

        .. versionadded:: 0.18

    presort : bool, optional (default=False)
        Whether to presort the data to speed up the finding of best splits in
        fitting. For the default settings of a decision tree on large
        datasets, setting this to true may slow down the training process.
        When using either a smaller dataset or a restricted depth, this may
        speed up the training.

    Attributes
    ----------
    classes_ : array of shape = [n_classes] or a list of such arrays
        The classes labels (single output problem),
        or a list of arrays of class labels (multi-output problem).

    feature_importances_ : array of shape = [n_features]
        The feature importances. The higher, the more important the
        feature. The importance of a feature is computed as the (normalized)
        total reduction of the criterion brought by that feature.  It is also
        known as the Gini importance [4]_.

    max_features_ : int,
        The inferred value of max_features.

    n_classes_ : int or list
        The number of classes (for single output problems),
        or a list containing the number of classes for each
        output (for multi-output problems).

    n_features_ : int
        The number of features when ``fit`` is performed.

    n_outputs_ : int
        The number of outputs when ``fit`` is performed.

    tree_ : Tree object
        The underlying Tree object.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : array-like or sparse matrix, shape = [n_samples, n_features]
            The training input samples. Internally, it will be converted to
            ``dtype=np.float32`` and if a sparse matrix is provided
            to a sparse ``csc_matrix``.

        y : array-like, shape = [n_samples] or [n_samples, n_outputs]
            The target values (class labels) as integers or strings.

        sample_weight : array-like, shape = [n_samples] or None
            Sample weights. If None, then samples are equally weighted. Splits
            that would create child nodes with net zero or negative weight are
            ignored while searching for a split in each node. Splits are also
            ignored if they would result in any single class carrying a
            negative weight in either child node.

        check_input : boolean, (default=True)
            Allow to bypass several input checking.
            Don't use this parameter unless you know what you do.

        X_idx_sorted : array-like, shape = [n_samples, n_features], optional
            The indexes of the sorted training input samples. If many tree
            are grown on the same dataset, this allows the ordering to be
            cached between trees. If None, the data will be sorted here.
